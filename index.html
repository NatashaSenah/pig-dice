      <h1>About Pig Dice</h1>
      <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 19
        45. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule vari
        ations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2] a
        nd Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probabil
        ity concepts.Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Kn
        izia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant typ
        e of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling
        for potential greater gains.</p>

      <h1>How to play</h1>
      <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled o
        r the player decides to "hold".If the player rolls a 1, they score nothi
        ng and it becomes the next player's turn.If the player rolls any other n
        umber, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.I
        f a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score,
        and it becomes the next player's turn.The first player to score 100 or m
        ore points wins.For example, the first player, Anne, begins a turn with
        a roll of 5. Anne could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll aga
        in. Anne rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but ch
        ooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scori
        ng. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he c
        hooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>
